This project was made as final project for the Algorithms and Data Structures II course.

Kruskal's algorithm finds a minimum spanning forest of an undirected edge-weighted graph. 
If the graph is connected, it finds a minimum spanning tree. 
(A minimum spanning tree of a connected graph is a subset of the edges that forms a tree that includes every vertex, 
where the sum of the weights of all the edges in the tree is minimized. For a disconnected graph, 
a minimum spanning forest is composed of a minimum spanning tree for each connected component.) 
It is a greedy algorithm in graph theory as in each step it adds the next lowest-weight edge that will not form a cycle to the minimum spanning forest.

The project includes a simple visualisation of the creation process that is presented in the terminal. The speed of the visualisation can be set by the defined constant in the program.
